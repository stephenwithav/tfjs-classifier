This webcam classifier lets you manually assign webcam frames to a specific class.

As a VERY simple example, think of three distinct facial expressions.

For example, A could represent an **ANGRY** face, B could represent a
**SHOCKED** face, and C could represent a big, **cheshire-style grin**.

With enough repetition, as many as 75 tests per expression, this app
can accurately detect your emotions.
